This is a simple Chess game I'm making for fun. Made one back in first year of Computing A-Level, but was far from ideal.

## Aims
* Actually **finish** one of these projects...
* 2 player functionality
* Potentially against an AI? (I'm currently studying a module on Artificial Intelligence @ University)
* Play against one another across a network (♞ v ♘)
* Convert it to Swing GUI (I may do this, but the CLI has some charm)
